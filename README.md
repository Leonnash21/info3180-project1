# Project 1 Code
Project one is an integration of a POSTGRES database, forms and profile generation with files uploads capabilities.
A login feature was implemented that allows a user who has created their profile to login using the credentials they submitted. 
This will allow them to navigate to secured pages and view profiles with the images they uploaded.
